# GitHub Repositories Listing Web App

![GitHub Repositories Listing](https://fyle-web-development-internship-task.vercel.app/projectSS.png)

## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the Fyle Web Development Internship application. The task was to design a web page that displays public GitHub repositories for a specific user. Instead of using Bootstrap and jQuery, I opted for the advantages of Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The goal was to create an intuitive user interface, implement server-side pagination, and optionally incorporate features like search functionality.

## Features

- Display public GitHub repositories for a specified user.
- Utilize Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.
- Implement server-side pagination with customizable repositories per page.
- Optional search functionality for dynamic repository filtering.
